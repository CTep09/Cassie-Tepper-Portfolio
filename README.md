# Cassie-Tepper-Portfolio

## Description 

This portfolio is a place where I can showcase my work and track my growth as a developer. In the portfolio there is a section about me, where you can learn about my background and experience. Contact information is located at the bottom of the page. This portfolio was created using HTML, CSS and the magical gift that is Google. 

# Lastly, if your project is deployed, include a link to the deployed application here.

## Usage 

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed. 

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

```md
![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
```
